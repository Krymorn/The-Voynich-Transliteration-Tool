# Contributing to The Voynich Transliteration Tool (TVTT)

The Voynich Transliteration Tool (TVTT) is currently developed and maintained by a single author. However, suggestions and feedback are very welcome.

You do not need to be a programmer to contribute — reports, ideas, documentation fixes, and suggestions are all valuable.

## Bug Reports

Include as much of the following as possible:
- A clear description of the problem  
- Steps to reproduce the issue  
- Your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux)

The more detail you provide, the easier it is to fix.

All code must remain:
